# Spell_Checker
This project is made by Anubhav, Asutosh, Bimlendu and me.
It is a simple python program that takes input from the user as a word or group of words, and matches it against the English language to check for any spelling errors and provide the most probable correct word or sentence. Therefore an input string from the user is returned back to him with possible corrections. We have equipped our code with basic interactive GUI for simpler execution.
You also need to download words.txt file too to run this code.
Feel free to give comments and point out our mistakes. We will try to resolve them.
